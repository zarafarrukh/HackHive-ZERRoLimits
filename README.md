## Overview
Interactive web app that helps users find personalized skin and hair care solutions by selecting body areas on a visual diagram and specifying their concerns. Using AI-driven recommendations, it searches for the best products and treatments tailored to individual needs, making skin and hair care advice more accessible and efficient.

## What it does
This website provides the users with an intuitive interface to select the specific body part they need assistance with. Upon selection, a guided questionnaire customizes recommendations based on the user's concerns. The platform then generates a personalized treatment plan or product recommendations based on their responses. To enhance accessibility, the website includes features such as screen reading support, highlighted links, and a dark mode option for an optimized user experience.

## How it was built
The website was developed using the ReactJS framework and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the static web content. To generate personalized treatment plans and product recommendations, we integrated Open AI, specifically ChatGPT 3.5, leveraging its advanced AI capabilities for accurate and tailored user solutions.
